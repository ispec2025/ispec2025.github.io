                    The 20th International Conference on Information Security
                    Practice and Experience (ISPEC 2025) will be held on
                    November 7-9, 2025 in Chengdu, organized by University of
                    Electronic Science and Technology of China, China and IEEE
                    Reliability Society. The ISPEC conference is an established
                    forum that brings together researchers and practitioners to
                    provide a confluence of new information security
                    technologies, including their applications and their
                    integration with IT systems in various vertical sectors. The
                    main goal of the conference is to promote research on new
                    information security technologies, including their
                    applications and their integration with IT systems in
                    various vertical sectors. Previous ISPEC has taken place in

                    <p class="lead">
                      Shui Yu is Professor of the School of Computer Science in
                      the Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology at
                      UTS, the Deputy Chair of the UTS Research Committee, and
                      is a researcher of cybersecurity, privacy and the
                      networking, communication aspects of Big Data, and applied
                      mathematics for computer science.<br /><br />
                      In 2013, he initiated a new field, networking for big
                      data, in the networking and communication domain. Shui was
                      the leading editor of Networking for Big Data, published
                      in 2015, which supplied an unprecedented look at
                      cutting-edge research on the networking and communication
                      aspects of Big Data.<br /><br />
                      Many of his research outputs have been adopted by
                      industry, for example, the auto scale strategy of Amazon
                      Cloud against distributed denial-of-service attacks.<br /><br />
                      As the corporate world has increasingly adopted new
                      technologies to analyze and store vast amounts of data in
                      a bid to generate valuable insights and unlock strategic
                      value, Shui has concentrated on the privacy and security
                      concerns associated with big data.<br /><br />
                      Among other issues, he has researched security issues
                      associated with smart grids, which present opportunities
                      to help solve the problems of carbon emissions and the
                      energy crisis.<br /><br />
                      He has also investigated creating anonymous transactions
                      on Blockchain to deal with threats to users' privacy. His
                      anonymous communication work for web browsing privacy has
                      been cited by more than 200 US patents.<br /><br />
                      He has published two monographs and edited two books, and
                      produced more than 600 technical papers, published in top
                      journals such as IEEE TPDS, TC, TIFS, TMC, TKDE, TETC,
                      ToN, and INFOCOM. His h-index is 80.<br /><br />
                      Shui serves his research communities in various roles,
                      including serving on the editorial boards of IEEE
                      Communications Surveys and Tutorials, IEEE Communications
                      Magazine and the IEEE Internet of Things Journal, among
                      others.<br /><br />
                      He has been a member of organizing committees for many
                      international conferences, such as the publication chair
                      for IEEE Globecom 2015, IEEE INFOCOM 2016 and 2017, TPC
                      chair for IEEE Big Data Service 2015, and general chair
                      for ACSW 2017.<br /><br />
                      He served as a Distinguished Lecturer of IEEE
                      Communications Society (2018-2021). He is a Distinguished
                      Visitor of IEEE Computer Society (2022-2024), a voting
                      member of IEEE ComSoc Educational Services board, and an
                      elected member of Board of Governors of IEEE
                      Communications Society and IEEE Vehicular Technology
                      Society, respectively. He is a Fellow of IEEE.<br /><br />
